# How do I scan multi-page double-sided documents when I only have a regular auto-feed scanner at hand?

There is no problem to quickly scan documents with any number of pages, if you have a scanner with an automatic feeder at hand. However, often MFPs have duplex duplex printing and a scanner that can only scan on one side, but has an automatic document feeder.

At the same time, scanning large double-sided documents looks like a problem that eats up a lot of time.

After all, if the document consists of only a few pages, then there is no need to mess with the command line, because you can manually glue the scans in any program that works with PDF, simply rearranging the pages or even manually turning them over on the scanner.

But what if an A4 document has several tens or even hundreds of pages?

# How to remove blank back pages from PDF after duplex scanning?

After solving the problem of quickly scanning large double-sided documents, another problem was discovered - a certain number of pages may turn out to be single-sided. And this means that the PDF will have white pages, for example, with scans of perforations or ring holes.

Of course, you can delete a few pages from a PDF manually, but what if there are hundreds of such files?
